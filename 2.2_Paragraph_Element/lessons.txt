Now the reason why we need a paragraph tag is because if you just had plain text in your HTML document,

This is a paragraph
This is a paragraph

when you run the code and you see it on a website, what you'll see is something like this:

This is a paragraph This is a paragraph

The text, they run into each other onto the same line and you can't actually tell where one paragraph begins and where the other ends.
On the other hand, if we had created two paragraph elements for these two lines,

<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>

then when we run the code, you will see them being separated with a line in between to be able to distinguish the different paragraphs.

This is a paragraph

This is a paragraph
