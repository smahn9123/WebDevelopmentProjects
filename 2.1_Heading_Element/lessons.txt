One important rule is notice how in our exercise there was only one h1.
It's not good practice to have more than one h1, because the h1 is the very top-level heading.
Don't have more than one h1. 
Instead, if you need another subtitle or another level of heading, then go to the h2 or h3 or all of the other ones up until h6.

Now the other thing to watch out for is don't skip a level when you're creating heading elements.
Don't jump between the different level headings.
These are not things that will break your code.
Your website will still look fine even if you break all of these rules, but they're just rules for convention.
